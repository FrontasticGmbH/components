# **Building accessible experiences**

## A guide to building accessible commerce websites

**Introduction**

Making sure you design your website while considering accessibility issues that may affect some of your customers, such as visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive impairments, allows you to have a more thoughtful design that can appeal to a wider audience while also improving the user experience for all your customers.

**Why accessibility matters**

Building accessible websites not only promotes inclusivity, but it is also a smart business decision as it includes the following benefits: .

* **Wider audience reach:** accessible websites are usable by a larger audience, including people with disabilities, who represent a significant market.
* **Enhanced brand reputation:** demonstrating a commitment to accessibility improves brand image and fosters customer loyalty.
* **Legal compliance:** many countries have mandates that ensure accessibility for e-commerce platforms, and non-compliance can result in legal penalties.
* **Improved UX (User experience) for all:** accessibility features often benefit everyone, not just people with alternative needs. For example, clear headings and concise language improve readability for all users.
* **Search Engine Optimization (SEO):** Accessibility helps with improved SEO metrics.

**WCAG:**

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines ([WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/)) provide the technical standards for most accessibility mandates. The store launchpad codebase targets [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) level AA as its foundation for web and digital accessibility. Level AA ensures usability and accessibility for a broader audience and is the most commonly targeted standard for compliance.

## **Accessibility from a UX/UI design perspective**

Design plays a crucial role in creating accessible experiences from the ground up. Key considerations include:

* Color contrast and visibility
* Typography and readability
* Interactive element sizing and spacing
* Clear visual hierarchy
* Consistent navigation patterns
* Content accessibility (ensuring form labels, error messages, and instructions are explicit and assistive)
* Error prevention and recovery
* Feedback and interaction

## **Accessibility from a developer perspective**

Development implementation ensures technical accessibility compliance. Focus areas include:

* Semantic HTML structure
* Accessible Rock Internet Applications (ARIA) labels and roles
* Keyboard navigation
* Screen reader compatibility
* Focus management

## **Key principles of WCAG**

WCAG  is built on four main principles: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust. Let's explore each principle with specific examples relevant to commercetools development:

### **Perceivable**

#### Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive. To ensure this, consider the following:

* **Text alternatives:** all non-text content (images, icons, etc.) must have text alternatives that describe their purpose.

  **Example:** ensure all product images have descriptive alt text in the commercetools product catalog. Use the `alt` attribute in the `<img>` tag to provide concise and informative descriptions.

* **Time-based media:** provide captions and transcripts for audio and video content.

  **Example:** if you have product demo videos on your site, use captions and transcripts.

* **Adaptable:** think about whether content can be presented in different ways, for example, a simpler layout, without losing information or structure.

  **Example:** use proper heading structure (\<h1\>, `<h2>`, etc.) to organize content. This allows screen readers to navigate the content effectively and enables your customers to customize how they display information.

* **Distinguishable:**  make it easier for your customers to see and hear content, including separating foreground from background.

  **Example:** use themes that provide sufficient color contrast between text and background. Adhere to WCAG contrast ratios.

###  **Operable**

#### User interface components and navigation must be operable. To ensure this, consider the following:

* **Keyboard accessible:** all functionality of the content is available through a keyboard interface without requiring specific timings for individual keystrokes.

  **Example:** ensure all interactive elements (such as buttons, links, form fields, carousels) on your website are operable using only the keyboard.

* **Enough time:** provide users enough time to read and use content.

  **Example:** if you have time limits on forms or checkout processes, provide mechanisms to allow users to extend those limits or turn them off completely.

* **Seizures and physical reactions:** do not design content in a way that is known to cause seizures or physical reactions.

  **Example:** avoid using flashing animations or rapidly changing content on your website.

* **Navigable:** provide ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are.

  **Example:** implement clear and consistent navigation menus, breadcrumb trails, and search functionality in your website. Use ARIA landmarks to define page regions.

### Understandable

#### Information and the operation of the user interface must be understandable. To ensure this, consider the following:

* **Readable:** make text content readable and understandable.

  **Example:** use clear and concise language in product descriptions, category names, and other content on your website. Use the commercetools theme editor to control font sizes and line spacing.

* **Predictable:** make Web pages appear and operate in predictable ways.

  **Example:** maintain consistent navigation and page layouts throughout your commercetools site. Use clear and consistent labeling for interactive elements.

* **Input assistance:** help users avoid and correct mistakes.

  **Example:** provide clear error messages and helpful input formatting in forms, for example, during registration, checkout, or contact forms.

### **Robust**

#### Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies. To ensure this, consider the following:

* **Compatible:** maximize compatibility with current and future user agents, including assistive technologies.

  **Example:** use semantic HTML and ARIA attributes correctly in your implementations. Ensure that custom components and integrations are compatible with assistive technologies.

## Testing and validation

* **Automated tools:** use automated accessibility testing tools to identify potential issues early in the development process. Integrate these tools into your development workflow.
* **Manual testing:** conduct manual testing with assistive technologies such as screen readers, keyboard navigation, and Microsoft Insights.
* **User feedback:** gather feedback from a variety of users, including those who use assistive technologies, throughout your development process to ensure your website meets their needs.
