## Linting

This project uses linting rules that improve the Core Web Vitals of frontastic
storefront.

Specifically, the following rules, which are also the recommended rules by
Next.js, are enabled:


`next/google-font-display` - Enforce optional or swap font-display behavior with Google Fonts

`next/google-font-preconnect` - Enforce preconnect usage with Google Fonts

`next/link-passhref` - Enforce passHref prop usage with custom Link components

`next/no-css-tags` - Prevent manual stylesheet tags

`next/no-document-import-in-page` - Disallow importing next/document outside of pages/document.js

`next/no-head-import-in-document` - Disallow importing next/head in pages/document.js

`next/no-html-link-for-pages` - Prohibit HTML anchor links to pages without a Link component

`next/no-img-element` - Prohibit usage of HTML <img> element

`next/no-page-custom-font` - Prevent page-only custom fonts

`next/no-sync-scripts` - Forbid synchronous scripts

`next/no-title-in-document-head` - Disallow using <title> with Head from next/document
    
`next/no-unwanted-polyfillio` - Prevent duplicate polyfills from Polyfill.io
    
`next/inline-script-id`	- Enforce id attribute on next/script components with inline content
    
`next/no-typos` - Ensure no typos were made declaring Next.js's data fetching function
    
`next/next-script-for-ga` - use the Script component to defer loading of the script until necessary.

In addition to those specific to Next.js and Core Web Vitals, the following
rules are included as well to get reasonable defaults:

`eslint:recommended`
`plugin:react/recommended` see [eslint-plugin-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react)
`plugin:react-hooks/recommended` see [eslint-plugin-react-hooks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-hooks)

If you want more fine-grained configuration, all of the above can be configured,
deactivated and/or extended in the `.eslintrc.json` in the project root folder.

To run the linter, just run
```
yarn lint
```

We recommend to add linting directly to your code editor or development environment,
to get immediate feedback.

### Linting in vim

There are a variety of extensions that can add linting support to vim and Neovim.
If you're using vim, we recommend either [ALE](https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale)
or [CoC](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) and if you use Neovim you can
use the integrated Language Server Protocol to run [eslint_d](https://github.com/mantoni/eslint_d.js/) in the background.
Here's [a handy guide](https://phelipetls.github.io/posts/configuring-eslint-to-work-with-neovim-lsp/) on how to do that

### Linting in Visual Studio Code

To integrate ESLint into Visual Studio Code, you will need to install the ESLint extension for Visual Studio Code. Search for ESLint in the Extensions tab and click Install once you have located the extension.
Once ESLint is installed in Visual Studio Code, youâ€™ll notice colorful underlining in your JS/TS files highlighting errors. These markers are color-coded based on severity. If you hover over your underlined code, you will see a message that explains the error to you.

## Prettier / Code formatting

We also recommend to setup your editor to use prettier to format a document on save.
