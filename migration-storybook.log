✅ Removing dependencies: @storybook/builder-webpack5, @storybook/manager-webpack5, storybook-addon-next-router
✅ Installing new dependencies: @storybook/nextjs
✅ Updating main.js
✅ Updating "framework" field
✅ Removing "core.builder" field
✅ Removing "core" field
❌ The migration failed to update your .storybook/main.js on your behalf because of the following error:
        ReferenceError: require is not defined

⚠️ Storybook automigrations are based on AST parsing and it's possible that your .storybook/main.js file contains a non-standard format (e.g. your export is not an object) or that there was an error when parsing dynamic values (e.g. "require" calls, or usage of environment variables). When your main config is non-standard, automigrations are unfortunately not possible. Please follow the instructions given previously and follow the documentation to make the updates manually.

The migration successfully updated your 'stories' config to include any .mdx file instead of just .stories.mdx.

It also ran the 'mdx-to-csf' codemod to convert your MDX stories to CSF format.
This codemod is not perfect however, so you may need to manually fix any issues it couldn't handle.
